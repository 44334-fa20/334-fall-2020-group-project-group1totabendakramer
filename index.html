            Scrumptious Catering did a fantastic job catering our 150-guest wedding reception last fall. The food was DELICIOUS, and we received tons of compliments on it from our guests!<br>
            Marcie worked with us to create an awesome menu of heavy hors d’oeuvres, including her parmesan crusted chicken bites, mini twice-baked potatoes, sliders and roll-ups, and unique and tasty homemade dips. Karen made a variety of cakes and cake balls that were both beautiful and delicious. Everything was fresh, homemade, and held up great throughout the reception. Marcie and her team spent a lot of time and energy on creating a beautiful display for the food also.<br>
            They are more than willing to help create a customized menu for your event. They always gave their honest opinions and let us make our own decision. I am SO glad I had their guidance and went with their suggestions! It turned out perfect! They also worked hard to help us stay within our budget, and accommodate guests with food allergies, both of which I am very grateful for.<br>
            We checked out a lot of caterers, and choosing Scrumptious Catering for our reception was one of the best decisions we made throughout the whole planning! They were over-the-top helpful, and not just in planning the food; they were also a huge help in coordinating many aspects of the reception. I could tell we were in really capable hands, which made our wedding preparation much less stressful.<br>
            Thank you a million times, Marcie and Karen. I wish we could eat your food every day.</p>

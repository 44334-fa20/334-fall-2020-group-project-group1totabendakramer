    <h3 div class="about">If you are feeling grumpy and are in need of a laugh, Danyea is just the person for the job. She has a personality that can make everyone smile. Very upbeat, hardworking, and always willing to help us out in any way she can. She is full of funny quotes that she has taken from her days of working at her Fathers restaurant. Even with her strong dislike of all things chocolate or cheesy; when she does try one of our menu items she likes we get treated to all kinds of new descriptive words for good food. Danyea semi retired from her career as a child psychologist. I hope she didn’t think this was going to be a move to slow down. But we don’t think she could slow down even if she wanted to.

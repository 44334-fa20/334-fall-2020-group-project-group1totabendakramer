    <h3 div class="about">Nikki is always around to help us out when we are in a bind and need some extra womanpower. Though she doesn’t work with us in the store on a daily basis anymore she has helped us out tremendously over the years. She is responsible for typing up the majority of the recipes and guides we use to get things done, and then making it easy for all of us to find when she isn’t around. I can honestly say I have no idea how I was able to function daily without everything she has done to help my business grow.

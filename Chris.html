    <h3 div class="about">The newest member of our staff is Chris. He is very talented in many areas. He learns very quickly and does every job given to him very well. Chris has a great personality and is very pleasant to work with.<br>

<br>The only nick -name we have for him so far is Tyler Jr- because he is very much like Tyler in a good way. Tyler introduced him to us.  Chris is interested in Physical Fitness and works out quite a bit. He is a Hockey fan with his favorite team being Chicago Black Hawks. He also helps with many aspects of Pros/Cons.<br>

<br>I feel lucky to have him and plan to keep him around as much as possible.</h3>
